Keegan, if love could be distilled into words, I fear even the most poetic verses would fail to capture the depth of my feelings for you. Still, I must try. This is not just a letter, nor is it a mere confession. It is an outpouring, an expression of a love so profound that it leaves me breathless every time I think of you.
