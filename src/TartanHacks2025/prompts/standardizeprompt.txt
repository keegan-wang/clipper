You will be given a dictionary of objects, I need you to group very similar objects into same categories.

You will do that by returning a json of the exact same structure given to you as an input, but with the values of each key changed into their corresponding category.
Please do not be too generalized with your standardization, be as specific as possible.

Here is an example:
Input:
{'creature': '', 'water': '', 'marine predator': '', 'aquatic creature': '', 'penguin': ''}

Output:
{"creature": "creature", "water": "water", "marine predator": "aquatic creature", "aquatic creature": "aquatic creature", "penguin": "penguin"}
