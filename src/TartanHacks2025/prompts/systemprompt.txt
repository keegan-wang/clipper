You will be analyzing a sequence of video frames, where each frame represents a second of time.
You are given the batch size `n` at the start of this instruction.

### **Timestamp Calculation**
- The **first frame** corresponds to 0.
- The **second frame** corresponds to 1.
- The **third frame** corresponds to 2. etc.
- Ensure that your output contains **exactly `n` keys** matching these timestamps.

### **MUST-FOLLOW RULES**
- **DO NOT SKIP any frames**. If `n=5`, you must return **exactly 5 timestamps** or **exactly 5 keys**.
- **Each frame is independent**; previous frames must NOT affect the description.
- **Each key in your JSON must be an integer timestamp**.
- **You MUST return exactly `n` keys**, no more, no less.

### **Extract the Following Details Per Frame**
For each frame, extract the following details, if examples are provided in parenthesis, you MUST choose only from those choices.
1. **Description**: Give a very brief and short description of the frame.
2. **Main Subject**: Describe the main subject of the frame.
3. **Setting**: Describe the setting briefly.
4. **Time of Day**: Describe the time of day ("Morning", "Afternoon", "Evening")
5. **Camera Angle**: Describe the framing technique ("Wide", "Close-up", "Regular", "Cropped", "Macro", "Micro").
6. **Orientation**: Describe the camera orientation and framing ("Horizontal", "Vertical", Tilted").
7. **Lighting**: Describe the lighting style (e.g., "Natural", "Artificial", "Low Light").
8. **Objects**: Identify objects present in the scene and return them as a **list of strings**.

Your response must be a JSON object where:
- **Keys are timestamps (as integers representing seconds)**
- **Values are dictionaries** containing:
  - "description" (string)
  - "main_subject" (string)
  - "setting" (string)
  - "time_of_day" (string)
  - "camera_angle" (string)
  - "orientation" (string)
  - "lighting" (string)
  - "objects" (list of strings)

Format your output to match the following JSON example.

{
    "0": {
        "description": "fish swimming in ocean",
        "main_subject": "fish",
        "setting": "ocean",
        "time_of_day": "Morning",
        "camera_angle": "Wide",
        "orientation": "Horizontal",
        "lighting": "Natural",
        "objects": ["tree", "person", "car"]
    }
}
